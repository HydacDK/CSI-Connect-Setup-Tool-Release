For setup via Cloud please note:
	- The device must be online (Cloud-LED breathing cyan).
	- If first time setup of device, make sure it is not claimed to another account.
	- You should sign into an account in the tool or if you do not have one create one using the tool.
The process:
	- Wait for device to connect to the cloud (Cloud-LED breathing cyan).
	- Sign in to or create your account from the "Overview" tab.
	- Click the "Find Device Online" button and wait for the window to open.
	- A list should appear that contains all devices claimed to your account that is online.

		- It is also possible to unclaim or rename already claimed devices.
	- Select a device from the list by clicking on it and click "OK".
	- The dialog should close and the Fields in "Device Info" should update with information on the selected device. The selector in the bottom left should also have updated to say "Cloud" indicating that you are "Connected" to a device via cloud.

	- On the settings tabs, when the wanted settings on a specific tab have been entered, click the "Save To Device" button and wait. As with reading from the device this takes a while, for some settings it can take up to a minute to save the settings.

	- It is possible to change settings for all devices no matter who has claimed it.
	- You do not need to sign in, but you can if you want to set up webhooks. (For setting up webhooks the device must be claimed to you.

	- If you want you can sign in.
	- Connect the device USB Port (You need to open the enclosure to access)
	- Click the "Update Connections" button, the selector should then show one or more COM Ports, depending of the number of CSI Connect devices connected.
	- Select a COM Device from the selector, only CSI Connect devices will show up.
